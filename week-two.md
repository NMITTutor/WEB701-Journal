# Week Two

## Framework Exploration

For week two we started exploring **web frameworks**. The course project requires an _investigation into three web frameworks_ which we need to analyse and select for our project.

I gained some experience with **React** and **Express** in the previous web course so I started by refreshing my self on Express by completing a linkedin tutorial last week, and followed up this week with a **Vue** tutorial. My plan is to find and complete a **Svelte** tutorial over the following week. These tutorials are very much step by step but allow me to gain familiarity and an understanding of the framework, what they are capable of, and what sort of resources are available.

## [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

Express has been around for a while now and its git repo show almost 6 million users. As a result, it is well documented and tutorials and resources are relatively easy to find.

Express is a back-end web framework built on top of Node.js, and provides a range of tools to make building a web server easier than in Node.js alone.

Although Express can push simple html through to a web browser, using it alone would probably be best suited for simple static websites. As the project requires a range of functionality, Express is not really suitable on it's own, but can provide some much needed backend support to a frontend framework.

If I end up using express in my project, it's main purpose will likely be to handle the http requests using route support.

## [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

Vue is an open source framework that was initially built by a single developer in an attempt to combine some of the best parts of other popular frameworks.

During the **Vue tutorial** I noticed a range of similarities between **Vue** and my previous work with **React**.

- Both frameworks use a **Virtual DOM**, which means only objects that have changed need to be re-rendered. My understanding is that this means less resources are used.
- Both frameworks can be **Component Based**. This allows alot of the code to be reused throughout the application. There are also many component libraries that are allready created meaning development can be much faster than starting everything from scratch.

My introduction to Vue has been quite pleasant, possibly more so than React. The **learning curve** for Vue doesn't seem quite so steep and I like the seperation of **template**, **code** and **style**. It gives me a sence of familiarity coming from **html**, **javascript** and **css**. I also found it easier to connect the data to the display, manage component state and pass around component properties and methods, which I struggled to get my head around when using React.

I am yet to find any real deficiencies in either framework which would sway me one way or the other. The determining factors seem to be externally based, such as Reacts larger community and widespread usage, probably due to its age.
I do feel that personally I would be able to pick up Vue slightly faster than React.

## Summary

Express.js as a backend framework and Vue.js as a frontend framework is a real contender for the upcoming project. I'm looking forward to investigating Svelte over the next week to see if there are any changes.

## Assignment Two - Milestone One

I have completed drafts for the **user requirements** and **site goals** section of the report. This involved analysing the project brief and supporting resources to reveal the overall idea behind the web app.

I will be continuing with the **user experience** and **site content** sections until next week when I will hopefully be able to begin the **site structure** section.
