# Week One

## Session One
The first session of WEB701 involved breaking down the course material to generate an understanding of course requirements. 

We broke into teams to analyse and create a small presentation conveying the course material to the class. The courses overall focus is on evaluation and implementation of modern web frameworks and is broken down into three assignments:
* Journal (10%)
* Analysis and Design (40%)
* Implementation (50%)

I'm looking forward to the content of this course as I really enjoyed the introduction to React, Redux and Express during the previous level 6 WEB class. I did feel however that there are so many frameworks available, and I look forward to adding a process for evaluating them to my currently limited tool kit. 

## Session Two
### Information Architecture
We looked at two short videos that described Information and Architecture.
#### Information
Information is the understanding we gain from analysing a certain set of data and its context. It's not simply the facts that we find, but the details that result by arranging the facts within the provided context to provide an accepted outcome.
#### Information Architecture
Architecture in general refers to the underlying design or structure. 
Information architecture can describe how information should be grouped and how it should link together which will potentially increase the value of our content for both the businesses and users. 

For our project we will need to consider grouping of our web content, and the structure of that information to allow navigation in a simple and logical way to help [satisfy the cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dln9xDsmCoY&feature=youtu.be).  

## Assignment Two - Milestone One
We analysed the analysis, design and report requirements for Milestone One of Assignment Two. Most of the requirements we will be familiar with from previous study. There was one note given which I will be attempting to follow which is related to our mindset during the design phase. This is to remove the thought process of delegating information to seperate web pages, and group information on its own merits prior to design. This will take some conscious effort as seperating information by page during design has occured naturally in the past. 

#### An interesting set of Information Architecture Principles sourced from [careerfoundry.com](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/a-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture/#1-what-is-information-architecture)
* **The principle of objects:** Content should be treated as a living, breathing thing. It has lifecycles, behaviors, and attributes.
* **The principle of choices:** More is less. Keep the number of choices to a minimum.
* **The principle of disclosure:** Show a preview of information that will help users understand what kind of information is hidden if they dig deeper.
* **The principle of exemplars:** Show examples of content when describing the content of the categories.
* **The principle of front doors:** Assume that at least 50% of users will use a different entry point than the home page.
* **The principle of multiple classifications:** Offer users several different classification schemes to browse the site’s content.
* **The principle of focused navigation:** Keep navigation simple and never mix different things.
* **The principle of growth:** Assume that the content on the website will grow. Make sure the website is scalable.
